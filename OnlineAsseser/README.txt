Install tesseract(It is a library by google for getting text from images)
if you check required_data.txt sample data is filled in
In the required_data.txt 

first line only username

second line password

third line tesseract.exe path go the directory where you installed tesseract and
copy the path of the file. It maybe something like this: C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe

You need to add chromedriver.exe. It depends upon your version of chome. Go to chrome->The 3 dots-> help->About Google Chrome. See the version 
and then download the appropriate chromedriver from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/

If it crashes send me the debuglog.log


How it works


It will take you to brainly first then solve the captcha(It sometimes may not show and the app will continue so go to brianly.com in a seperate tab and solve the captcha)
If you don't want to solve captcha then just change the url to any website and press enter it will continue then

Then as soon as it detects the test it will join (you do not need to touch anything). Then for every question it will load you 2 pages right next to you with answers.
If you want you can close them after getting it otherwise there will be too many pages
